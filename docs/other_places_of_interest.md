In this sublist there are some places that might be a bit off the beaten path and
where one could stay for a days to fully appreciate.

Unless marked, I haven't done these, but they're on my radar.

# Biking Excursions

<https://travel.rakuten.com/campaign/ranking/cyclist/>

## Shinminami kaido
I've done this one.  It's great!

Between the islands of Honshu and Shikoku are a large chain of mini islands.
There is a single continuous biking route that runs along a chain of mini
island connecting the two larger islands.  The scenery is gorgeous.
There are lots of restaurants and guesthouses catering to tourists. There
are cultural sites, like a historical pirate castle and museums, etc.

You can rent a bike on one side of the route and drop it off on the other end.  It's about ~50 miles?

**Length:** 1 intense day, 2 leisurely days

**Area:** Near Hiroshima, quite a bit south of Osaka.

One of the traditional roads from Kyoto to Tokyo. Some segments are still
maintained like they used to be. Many parts no longer exist as I understand.

**Length:** 1/2 day to 7 days, depending on the route and distance covered

**Area:** Between Tokyo and Kyoto

# Art Excursions

To revitalize local economies, Japan has invested significant money in
the arts in specific rural communities.  Abandoned houses are turned into artists
workshops.  Vistors can spend the day walking around a town, visiting different art
installations.  Some places require a bike or car to fully access.

Every 3 years they hold a festival where more works are added to those that are
permanently on display.

There are two that I know of:

## Setouchi Triennale
I've done this one.  It's fantastic!

Electric Bicycles and ferries are used to get around.

I visited just Naoshima and Teshima but there are many other islands involved.
I spent one full day on Naoshima and one full day on Teshima.

The nearby port city of Takamatsu seems to have some beautiful hiking spots.

# Cultural Excursions

## Nikko

Nikko has a nice, gentle hike through a beautiful forest that passes along several temples.
It's a world heritage site.  From Nikko, one can take a bus to Lake Chuzenji and go hiking
in a marsh.  Very popular in October when the leaves change colors. Nearby is an onsen area
with a recreated Japanese village (Edo Wonderland Nikko Edomura) that has regular cultural performances.

Doable as a long day trip from Tokyo if just doing the forest hike but better spread over several days.
I did just the forest walk as an overnight trip from Tokyo.

**Length:** 1~4 days

**Area:** About 2 hours north of Tokyo by train
