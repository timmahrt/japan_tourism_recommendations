## First time itinerary

If you think you'll only visit Japan one time I recommend coming to Japan for at least a week.
Rent a one-week unlimited rail pass and spend half the time in Tokyo and half the time in Kyoto.

Better is to visit Tokyo on one trip and Osaka/Kyoto/Kobe on a separate visit
with daytrips to nearby places in the countryside.

With more time or specific interests, there are lots of interesting places outside of Tokyo and Osaka but
these two areas are the most "dense" with things.

Most of the items listed here for Tokyo and Osaka are places I've visited and can personally recommend.

## Getting into Japan

Four of the five main islands in Japan have a major international airport that you can fly directly into
(Okinawa -> Naha Airport, Hokkaido -> New Chitose Airport, Kyushu -> Fukuoka).  Honshu has three:
Narita and Haneda in the Tokyo area and Kansai Airport in the Osaka/Kyoto/Kobe area.

If you intend
to primarily visit an area outside of Tokyo, it will be cheaper and save time to fly directly to one of those
airports, as opposed to flying into Tokyo and transiting to your destination.


## Rail passes

"JR" is the company that runs most routes between cities and also some routes within cities.

Their routes include both normal trains and the faster "shinkansen" bullet trains. While fast,
tickets are not cheap but foreign tourists can buy rail passes at big discounts. For example,
the one week unlimited pass costs about $300 which is the same cost as round trip tickets
from Tokyo to Osaka.

For my first trip to Japan I bought a 3 week pass and spent a month bouncing around the country.
Its a lot of bang for your buck!

They're cheaper to pre-purchase than to buy on arrival.

## Getting Help in English

Most cities with tourist attractions will have a tourist office and the staff usually
know at least some English (many have excellent English!). In Tokyo, major train stations
may have tourist information.

Often times they will hand out free paper maps with places of interest marked.
Be sure to ask about local food specialties and local events. When I visited Furano,
coincidently I arrived on the day before their annual "Belly Button Festival".

## Internet

Things are changing but "free wifi" in Japan often require you to register with a local
phone number before using, even in cafes.  Really free wifi is accessible in hotels,
tourist information centers, and major transportation hubs.

You might find a pocket wifi helpful.  It acts like a mobile
router that you can use to connect to the internet from your phone or computer from anywhere.
Prices should be reasonable with customizable plays (1 week, 2 weeks, etc). You can get
these in any international airport and drop them off on your way out of the country.

## Money

Things are changing in Japan, but I still recommend carrying enough cash for daily activities.
Restaurants, shops, and cultural venues may not accept credit cards.
Most ATMs do not accept foreign cards but there are two exceptions: post offices (JP Post)
and 7-11.  Both are common enough that I never had any problems getting money.
