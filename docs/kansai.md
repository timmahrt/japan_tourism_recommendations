# Kansai

The second largest metropolitan area in Japan.  Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe are all within ~30 minutes of each other by train.  Even though its one continuous area, each city has a very different vibe.

- Gion - traditional crafts and shopping area.  If you are interested, we might be able to see a traditional geisha music performance.  A typical private one will not be possible to arrange but there are group performances/tea ceremonies intended for tourists.

- Fushimi Inari Shine - visually very distinctive.  It features a footpath up a mountain that is completed covered in red tori gates.  It is a lot of walking of course.

## Kobe
Kobe is famous for Kobe beef and Jazz clubs

  There are lots of hiking routes in the area too, a lake at the top of the mountain, and a European-style formal garden area.

## Nara

A little bit farther out, Nara was the capital of Japan for a short time.  It has lots of temples
and is famous for its semi-tame deer that walk around the city.

## Daytrips / Overnight trips
- Koya san - its possible to stay overnight at one of the temples 
- Awaji island

  I haven't been here, but its just off the coast of Kobe. There is even a Dragon Quest theme park there!

- Himeji

  Himeji is famous for its castle, perhaps the most beautiful in Japan.
  You can walk around the castle grounds and go up to the top of the castle.
  You can combine a visit to the castle with a visit to Shosha, a forest temple
  complex on the edge of town.

  I did both as an overnight trip from Kobe

- Arima onsen - an onsen town nestled in the mountains behind Kobe

- Ise - the most important Shinto shrine is located here
