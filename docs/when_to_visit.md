# When to visit

For general tourism around Japan, I think April to May and October to November would be the best core months,
although weather varies greatly from Okinawa to Hokkaido. Other months can be fine but with
complications.

June is the rainy season.  Rain can be a nuisance but it usually doesn't rain all day, every day in Tokyo.
(Yakushima, one of the wettest places in Japan, is another story...)
July and August are hot and humid (80~90F). January and February are cold (30~40F). It rarely
snows in Tokyo.

Typhoon season is generally August and September. For Tokyo this usually means lots of rain and wind.
Even during typhoons, unless severe, businesses are still open and the trains are usually still running,
although perhaps with different hours or more limited service.

## Seasonal events

Cherry blossom season is a unique, festive time to visit Japan.  It only lasts for about a week or two
and starts sometime in March or April usually. The weather can still be wintery--my first "hanami" party
under a cherry blossom tree was on a day with icy rain.

If you like fireworks, cities around Japan host firework shows in July and August.

Otherwise, it may be helpful to research in advance seasonal festivals that you might be interested in.
Eg the Sapporo snow festival which happens in February.

# When to not visit

The first week of May is Golden Week with a long string of national holidays,
and the end of December and start of January is when families get together for the new year.

During those time periods, hotels are more expensive or are fully booked and tourist attractions
are more crowded.  A lot of attractions and restaurants are closed for the New Years holidays.
