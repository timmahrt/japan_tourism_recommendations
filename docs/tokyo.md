## Things to see in Tokyo

There are lots of tourist attractions but the different neighborhoods of Tokyo
themselves can be an interesting place to visit. Akihabara aka "electronic town" is
a shopping center famous for electronics and anime goods.
It's fun to just wander around. Nakano Broadway has a similar vibe.

Ueno in the north part of Tokyo features a massive park that includes several
museums and a zoo.  Just south of the park is a shopping street, Ameyoko, lined with
small, lively restaurants.


- Shinjuku crossing - very busy intersection with lots of neon lights
