## Typical Japanese food

Below is a list of some of the basics that are widely available but there are
lots of regional specialties or dishes made from specific seasonal vegetables, etc
that I won't list here.

<https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e620.html>

- ramen, soba, udon (different styles of noodles served in different ways)
- sushi (raw fish)
- karaage (Japanese style fried chicken)
- kushikatsu (Osaka specialty of skewered meats and vegetables, dipped in a sweet/salty sauce)
- tonkatsu (deep-friend pork filet)
- nabe (soup)
- tempura (deep fried meats and vegetables)

There are restaurants that specialize in making nabe.  Usually the guests sit around a pot.
A prepared soup will either be brought out or the guests will choose ingredients and make the
soup themselves. I had some motsu nabe (organ meat soup) in Fukuoka that was perhaps the most
delicious thing I have ever eaten.

- onigiri (rice balls stuffed with assorted ingredients)

The Japanese version of the sandwich.  Great for when you don't have time for a meal

- bento (Japanese lunch boxes -- often bought at a train station before hopping on a long train ride)
- takoyaki (fried balls of dough with octopus, mayonaise, and savory sauce)
- Okonomiyaki - savory Japanese pancakes

There are two famous varieties: Hiroshima Style and Osaka style

- Japanese curry
- don (rice bowl)

'don' is a suffix that just means "rice bowl" for example "Tori don" is a bowl of rice with chicken on top.
"Unagi don" is a rice bowl with eel on top, etc.


## Vegetarian food

Vegetables are very popular in Japanese cuisine, but it is difficult to find strictly vegetarian
food in Japan. Even for food with no meat in it, the sauce or broth may contain meat.

With my vegetarian friends, we usually eat at a Nepalese restaurant. There are many in Tokyo these days.

Vegetarian food may be available at/near Buddhist temples.

## Convenience stores

Unlike in the West, Japanese convenience store food is considered to be good, or even very good
quality fast food with stores in urban areas being stocked multiple times per day.

## Picky eaters

For very picky eaters, Western chains like KFC and McDonalds are safe choices as are Japanese
"family restaurants" like Jonathan's, Gusto, and Royal Host. These restaurants all
have a mix of both Japanese and Western food (soup, salad, burgers, steak, pizza).
Saizeriya is a popular local Italian chain if you feel like pasta.

- Jonathan's <https://www.skylark.co.jp/en/jonathan/menu/index.html>
- Gusto <https://www.skylark.co.jp/en/gusto/menu/index.html>
- Royal Host <https://www.royalhost.jp/menu/>
- Saizeriya <https://www.saizeriya.co.jp/>

For picky eaters in a pinch, convenience stores (7-11, Family Mart, Lawsons) are everywhere
and sell Western food like egg-salad sandwiches, burritos, and even decent hamburgers that
are microwaved when you buy it. I also recommend ongiri (rice balls stuffed with/coated
with various toppings) as the Japanese equivalent of a sandwich. Be sure to order a
"Famichiki" chicken nugget from the cash register at a Family Mart at least one time.

They also have familiar snacks like Pringles and Snickers bars.

## Izakaya

For groups with mixed tastes, Izakaya are a safe choice.  Izakaya are drinking establishments that
often serve small plates meant to be shared
(if you don't drink alcohol, its fine). So if someone doesn't like seafood, someone might order
sushi while someone else might order fried chicken

There are lots of popular chains but the best places can be the small local restaurants, if you can find them!

If you're stuck, here are some safe choices
- Yamachan - specializes in chicken wings <https://www.yamachan.co.jp/english/>
- Nojyo - has a kindof farm-to-table theme and some of their restaurants have completely different menus <https://www.tsukadanojo.jp/>

## Japanese diner chains

There are a lot of chains but here are a few I frequent for quick, cheap eats.
A meal at one of these places is usually $5-$10.

- Coco ichiban - Japanese curry restaurant - **one of my favorites**.  Has an extensive menu in English and you can customize the spiciness of the curry. Some locations even offer a real vegetarian menu. <https://www.ichibanya.co.jp/english/>
- Matsuya - Gyudon (beef bowl) restaurant - large English menu. Sells a variety of dishes over rice <https://www.matsuyafoods.co.jp/english/menu/>
- Yoshinoya - Gyudon restaurant, similar to Matsuya <https://www.yoshinoya.com/en/>
- Tenya - Tepura don (tempura over rice) restaurant <https://www.tenya.co.jp/english/>
- Fujisoba - soba noodle restaurant - <https://fujisoba.co.jp/eng/>
